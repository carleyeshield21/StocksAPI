## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

stock_params = {
    'function':'TIME_SERIES_WEEKLY',
    'symbol': STOCK_NAME,
    'interval':'1min',
    'apikey':STOCK_API_KEY,
}

response = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT,params=stock_params)
stocks_data = response.json()
# print(stocks_data)
# print('=======')
stocks_data1 = response.json()['Weekly Time Series']
# print(stocks_data1)
# stocks_data_meta = response.json()['Meta Data']
# print(stocks_data_meta)

# data_list = [new_item for item in list] -> keyword for a list comprehension
# but we are dealing with a dictionary so we use the keyword below to create a list so we can use the index of each item instead of the key which is a date that changes everytime, this will be hard coded everytime because the date changes everyday, unlike the list which we will use to have 0 and 1 as our target data everytime, we are interested only in the value from the dictionary
# data_list_key = [key for(key,value) in stocks_data1.items()]
# print(data_list_key)
data_list_value = [value for(key,value) in stocks_data1.items()]
# print(data_list_value)

# last week's data
print(data_list_value[0])
# data from two weeks ago
print(data_list_value[1])

# from the two dictionaries above, we need to compare the closing value for each, which means that we are interested in the value of the key:'4. close'

last_week_close_value = data_list_value[0]['4. close']
print(last_week_close_value)

two_weeks_close_value =  data_list_value[1]['4. close']
print(two_weeks_close_value)


#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

diff_closing_value = abs(float(last_week_close_value) - float(two_weeks_close_value))
print(diff_closing_value)

#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.

percent_diff = (diff_closing_value / float(last_week_close_value)) * 100
print(percent_diff)

#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this: 
"""
